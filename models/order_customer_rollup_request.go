// OrderCustomerRollupRequest Aggregate orders per organization. Send

// attributable order. Both forms are paged and time-budgeted the same way —

    // every call of a loop, otherwise the windows drift by the duration of the
    // loop.
    AsOf string `json:"as_of"`
    // Continue an unfinished scan: the exact value the previous call returned,
    // which is the id of the last order it read. Do not construct one — it is a
    // resume point, not an offset. Omit it on the first call. It is honoured in
    // BOTH call shapes, organization_ids included: send the whole batch again
    // alongside it whenever `done` came back false, or the part of the batch
    // after the cursor is simply never read.
    Cursor string `json:"cursor"`
    // Roll up exactly these organizations and no others — at most 200, because
    // the ids travel to the data plane as one in.() filter. Naming them does NOT
    // make the answer complete by itself: the scan is the same paged,
    // time-budgeted loop either way, so a batch with more orders than one page
    // can still stop early with `done: false` and a cursor. Small batches finish
    // in one call, which is the normal case, but check `done` rather than assume
    // it. Omitted = scan every order and answer for every organization that
    // appears on one.
    OrganizationIds []string `json:"organization_ids"`
    // Which lifecycle statuses count as revenue. Defaults to placed,
    // in_fulfillment and completed: a pending order was never placed, and a
    // cancelled one is not revenue. Widening this is how a merchant who books on
    // approval gets their own definition of the same numbers.
